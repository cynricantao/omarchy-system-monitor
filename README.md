# System Monitor

Read-only Omarchy/Quickshell bar widget for CPU, RAM, NVIDIA/AMD GPU, grouped applications, temperatures, storage and network rates.

Plugin ID: `cynricantao.system-monitor`. Requires Omarchy's native `qs.Ui`/`qs.Commons` APIs and `/usr/bin/python3` (standard library only). NVIDIA metrics optionally use `/usr/bin/nvidia-smi`; AMD metrics use the kernel's `amdgpu` sysfs interface. Missing or unsupported telemetry is shown as unavailable. No root privileges, separate service or Python packages are needed. Intel GPU telemetry and per-application GPU usage are not implemented.

## Screenshots

These are captures of the actual QML interface in an isolated preview session,
using **synthetic demonstration telemetry**. Hardware labels, application names,
resource percentages and storage values are examples—not the maintainer's
computer. No personal desktop, real process list or private mount path is shown.

## Quick walkthrough

1. **Open the dashboard:** click any RAM, CPU or GPU bar icon/percentage.
2. **Inspect applications:** Processes shows the top five grouped applications.
   Use RAM/CPU to change sorting, RSS/PSS to compare memory accounting, and See
   all to expand the list. Missing PSS remains unavailable rather than becoming RSS.
3. **Explore other views:** Temps shows available sensors; Storage shows
   filesystem capacity; Network shows per-interface traffic rates and histories.
4. **Open Details:** inspect available RAM/swap, CPU cores, disk rates, load,
   uptime and metric interpretation notes in the scrollable detail view.
5. **Close with Escape or an outside click:** detailed process scans stop when
   closed; the bar continues its lightweight resource sampling.

## Install, update and remove

Review the code before enabling it: Omarchy plugins run unsandboxed as your user.

```sh
omarchy plugin add https://github.com/cynricantao/omarchy-system-monitor.git --enable
omarchy plugin update cynricantao.system-monitor
omarchy plugin remove cynricantao.system-monitor
```

No install hook or separate service is required; the shell starts the read-only
collector when the widget loads. Removing the plugin stops its widget/child collector;
there is no plugin-created persistent monitoring history to erase.

## Use

Click a RAM/CPU/GPU bar icon or percentage to toggle the popup; Escape or an outside click closes it. The default Processes view shows five grouped applications; See all expands the list. RAM/CPU switches sorting; RSS/PSS switches the memory definition. Temperatures, Storage, Network and Details expose additional metrics. Popup width targets 440 scaled pixels; height is capped at the smaller of 460 scaled pixels and 44% of the active screen height. Scroll longer lists inside the popup.

## Metrics and sampling

- CPU: `/proc/stat` interval deltas excluding idle and iowait; normalized to whole-machine 0–100%. Guest time is not double-counted.
- RAM: `(MemTotal - MemAvailable) / MemTotal`, treating reclaimable cache as available.
- Application CPU: summed user/system tick deltas normalized by logical core count. Opening requires two samples; PID reuse is detected and exited processes are not retained.
- RSS: summed resident pages from `/proc/PID/stat`. Shared pages count in each process, so group totals can exceed attributable physical memory. PSS: summed readable `smaps_rollup` proportional memory; a missing PSS for any nonzero-RSS process makes that group's PSS unavailable, never a mixture of RSS and PSS. Application totals need not equal system-used RAM.
- Common browser/Steam helpers join their application group. Other executables group by basename; interpreter-based programs may share a Python/Node group. Kernel threads are grouped.
- GPU: NVIDIA via `nvidia-smi`, or AMD via `/sys/class/drm/card*/device` with the `amdgpu` driver: utilization, VRAM, temperature and power. AMD fan percentage is measured RPM divided by maximum RPM, not PWM duty; it is unavailable without both counters. Missing/denied sysfs metrics remain unavailable independently. AMD names use `product_name` when exposed, otherwise a generic AMD label with the PCI device ID. On integrated GPUs, VRAM is the driver's reported VRAM pool, not all shared system memory. A working NVIDIA query takes priority; otherwise AMD is used. The dashboard displays the first card from the selected backend, not a multi-GPU aggregate.
- Network: per-interface receive/transmit counter deltas; tunnels can overlap physical traffic. Disk rates use whole block devices, not partitions. Storage deduplicates same-source/same-capacity mounts.
- One Python collector samples every two seconds **after collection**. Process and smaps scans occur only while the popup is open. CPU/RAM/GPU history keeps 60 samples; per-interface network history keeps 60 points updated only while open. Histories are in memory. Detail cost depends on process count and memory maps; no performance guarantees or published benchmark claims are made.
- Bar metrics become stale after eight seconds without a successful sample. Collector restart attempts occur every ten seconds after failure. Animations are finite.

## Local management and IPC

Once installed through Omarchy's plugin workflow:

```sh
omarchy plugin enable cynricantao.system-monitor --section right
omarchy plugin disable cynricantao.system-monitor
omarchy-shell cynricantao.system-monitor status
omarchy-shell cynricantao.system-monitor open
omarchy-shell cynricantao.system-monitor close
omarchy-shell cynricantao.system-monitor toggle
omarchy-shell cynricantao.system-monitor view applications
omarchy-shell cynricantao.system-monitor view processes
omarchy-shell cynricantao.system-monitor view temperatures
omarchy-shell cynricantao.system-monitor view storage
omarchy-shell cynricantao.system-monitor view network
omarchy-shell cynricantao.system-monitor view details
omarchy-shell cynricantao.system-monitor sort cpu
omarchy-shell cynricantao.system-monitor sort memory
omarchy-shell cynricantao.system-monitor memory rss
omarchy-shell cynricantao.system-monitor memory pss
```

`status` returns only popup/collector health and selected UI state, not telemetry. `view all` is an alias for applications; unknown views select processes, unknown sorts select memory, and unknown memory modes select RSS. Controls change presentation and whether detailed sampling runs, not monitored applications or system settings. These are **unsandboxed local shell IPC**, not authenticated remote APIs. See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).

## Privacy

No analytics, telemetry uploads, HTTP requests, credentials, command-line arguments, environment variables or process-memory contents are collected. The collector reads system counters, hardware sensor labels, GPU model/metrics, executable **basenames**, process IDs/parent IDs/timing/resident memory and PSS totals. It resolves executable symlinks internally but does not emit their full paths. Opening the popup additionally reads mount paths/capacity, load and uptime. Process/mount/interface names can reveal private activity even without command lines.

Snapshots travel over a local child-process stdout pipe into the shell; transient process metadata and histories remain in memory, not plugin-created files. Closing clears detailed snapshots/process baselines; metric and network histories remain until the shell exits. Existing OS/shell logs or crash dumps may retain data independently. Screenshots and copied output can disclose activity: review/redact them before sharing. The plugin shares the shell user's permissions and is not a security boundary.

## Verification

Run from the repository root:

```sh
PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=1 python3 -m unittest discover -v
omarchy plugin validate "$PWD"
```

Tests cover accounting and collector/IPC/source security contracts, including AMD sysfs parsing, missing metrics and GPU fallback. Some source checks are structural; GPU tests use mocked NVIDIA responses and synthetic AMD sysfs trees. These do not prove live QML rendering. Plugin validation checks manifest compatibility, not runtime or visual acceptance. Validate live behavior separately before release; this public candidate has not been installed or used to restart the shell during preparation.

## License and compatibility

Its retained MIT notice is in [THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md](THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md). The compatibility copy adds `qs.Ui`, a fixed dark background and square corners; review it after shell API updates. System Monitor does not provide process killing or btop's full inspection features.
